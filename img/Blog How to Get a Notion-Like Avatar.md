How I got this Free Notion Like Avatar? (That's me btw ðŸ˜‰)

Twitter has a trend that if you are a Notion creator, you gotta have this dope Notion-Like Avatar, and I know that's why you ended up here! Since Prototion is all about empowering **_[Notion Makers](https://prototion.com/sell-notion-templates?referral=blog.prototion.com)_**, I thought of doing this blog for you all.

So, there are couple of ways to get your own Notion Avatar. There is a free one that we will discuss in the end, but before that let's support the designer community a bit and check out some awesome Designers creating Avatars at affordable prices.

## Paid Options

Okay, first things first - why would you want a Paid Notion Avatar if there is a free version available? Well, apart from supporting the hard-working artists, you can add more character to your avatar in this option. It will look a lot more like you, and much less like a generic version.
